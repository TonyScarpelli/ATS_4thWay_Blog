We are still trying to figure out how to create and edit markdown files.

So far I have a WordPad file called "New Post Code.rtf".

Open it up.

Create a new markdown post in "\src\content\posts:: post-n-md

Copy the code from New Post Code.rtf.

Paste it in the the new markdown file.

Do the editing.

The best way? Don't know yet.
