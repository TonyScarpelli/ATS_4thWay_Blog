Over the years (80) I've been collecting a lot of handy hints.
Here are a few that I think are easy and good.

If you have several keys on the same ring that look alike, put a dab of epoxy on the one that is most used.

Tums is good, but you can't use it close to when you take a statin drug. So a 1/2 tsp of baking soda in a 1/4 cup of water will do the trick. My grandfather was a big coffee drinker, and probably ate a lot of things he shouldn't have, always asked my grandmother "Nora, please make me a bicarb."

Have a metal coffee cup that is turning brown. Drop a 'Polyident Overnight' tablet into a water filled cup, overnight. I have to use 2 of them, but after a bit of rough sponge cleaning, clean as a whistle.

An outlet should have it's ground hole on the bottom. That is because wires lean down and will help keep the ground wire in. Many types of bad electrical problems happen when not doing this.
