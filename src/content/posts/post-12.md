Over the years (80) I've been collecting a lot of handy hints.
Here are a few that I think are easy and good.

If you have several keys on the same ring that look alike, put a dab of epoxie on the one that is most used.

Tums is good, but you can't use it close to when you take a statin drug. So a 1/2 tsp of baking soda in a 1/4 cup of water will do the trick. My grandfather was a big coffee drinker, and probably ate a lot of things he shouldn't have, always asked my grandmother "Nora, please make me a bicarb."

Have a metal coffee cup that is turning brown. Drop a 'Polydent Overnight' tablet into a water filled cup, overnight. I have to use 2 of them, but after a bit of rough sponge cleaning, clean as a whistle.
