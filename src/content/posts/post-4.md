That image above is a Hyper Cube.<br>
It comes from the modern mathematics called Topology. My interest in it came about through my interest in Moebius strips. I read a book called _The Mathematical Magpie_, edited by Clifton Fadiman. It was a wonderful trip into fourth dimensional spaces and beyond.<br>
